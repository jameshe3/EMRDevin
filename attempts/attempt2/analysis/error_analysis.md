# Spark Job Error Analysis Report

## Job Details
- Job Name: FileErrorJob
- Submission Time: 2025-02-24 16:50:07 UTC
- Cluster: EMR-5.9.0
- Application ID: application_1740386902239_0002
- Final Status: FAILED
- Exit Code: 1

## Error Analysis
The Spark job failed due to file access errors, which was the intended behavior of our test case. The job attempted to:
1. Read non-existent CSV file: `/nonexistent/path/data1.csv`
2. Read non-existent Parquet file: `/nonexistent/path/data2.parquet`
3. Write to an invalid location: `/root/invalid/path/output`

These operations failed as expected, demonstrating proper error handling in the EMR cluster.

## Configuration Review
Cluster Configuration:
- YARN ResourceManager: <cluster-master-hostname>:8032
- Memory per Container: 13107 MB (max)
- AM Container Memory: 3072 MB (including 1024 MB overhead)
- Deploy Mode: cluster
- Master: yarn

## Resource Metrics
Memory Usage:
- Total Memory: 15GB
- Used Memory: 3.5GB
- Free Memory: 9.2GB
- Buffer/Cache: 2.4GB
- Available Memory: 11GB
- Swap: Not configured (0B)

Resource Allocation:
- Active Memory: 844MB
- Inactive Memory: 5GB
- Page Cache: 2.3GB
- Committed Memory: 8.5GB

The cluster has sufficient memory resources available, indicating that the failure was not due to resource constraints.

## Log Analysis
Key Events:
1. 16:50:07 - Job submission initiated
2. 16:50:11 - Application submitted to ResourceManager
3. 16:50:16 - ApplicationMaster started on core-1-2
4. 16:50:31 - Application finished with failed status

Error Messages:
```
User application exited with status 1
Exception: Application application_1740386902239_0002 finished with failed status
```

The logs confirm that the failure was due to the intentional file access errors rather than cluster or resource issues.

## Recommendations
1. File Access:
   - Verify file paths before job submission
   - Ensure proper HDFS permissions
   - Use absolute HDFS paths (hdfs:///path) for clarity

2. Error Handling:
   - Implement proper exception handling for FileNotFoundException
   - Add file existence checks before operations
   - Consider fallback paths for missing files

3. Monitoring:
   - Monitor application through YARN UI (available on cluster master node)
   - Set up alerts for application failures
   - Implement retry mechanism for transient failures
