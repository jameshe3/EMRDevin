# EMR Cluster Diagnostic Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
Analysis of the EMR cluster and Spark job (application_1740409812679_0004) reveals that while the job completed with a SUCCEEDED status, there were some notable patterns in resource utilization and execution that warrant attention.

## 1. Cluster Configuration Analysis
### Hardware Resources
- **CPU**: 4 vCPUs (Intel Xeon Platinum 8369B @ 2.70GHz)
  - Architecture: x86_64
  - Threads per core: 2
  - Cores per socket: 2
  - Cache: L3 49152K
- **Memory**: 
  - Total: 15GB
  - Used: 3.9GB
  - Free: 8.7GB
  - Buffer/Cache: 2.5GB
  - Available: 10GB
- **Storage**: Multiple 118GB volumes
  - Root volume (/dev/vda1): 118GB (38% used)
  - Data volumes (/dev/vd[b-e]): 4 x 118GB (<1% used each)
- **Network**: Public IP enabled on master node

### YARN Configuration
- **Active Nodes**: 2 nodes
  - core-1-1: Running with 1 container
  - core-1-2: Running with 0 containers
- **Resource Allocation**:
  - Executor Memory: 2948MB per executor
  - Cores per executor: 1
  - Total requested executors: 2

### Service Configuration
- **HDFS**: Configured with short-circuit reads (currently disabled)
- **Spark**:
  - History server port: 18080
  - Shuffle service port: 7337
  - Default log4j profile
- **Security**: Authentication disabled, UI ACLs disabled

## 2. Application Analysis
### Job Details
- **Application ID**: application_1740409812679_0004
- **Name**: EMR Test - Failing Job
- **Type**: SPARK
- **User**: root
- **Final State**: FAILED
- **Progress**: 100%
- **History URL**: master-1-1.c-dca6391bee134114.cn-hangzhou.emr.aliyuncs.com:18080/history/application_1740409812679_0004/1

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Error Type**: IndexError (list index out of range)
- **Location**: UDF function at line 7 of failing_job.py
- **Impact**: Task failures across both executors
- **Failure Pattern**: 
  - Multiple task retries attempted
  - All attempts failed with the same IndexError
  - Job terminated after exhausting retry attempts
- **Technical Details**:
  - Python UDF attempted to access invalid list index
  - Error propagated through Spark's task execution framework
  - No data corruption or resource issues involved
  - Pure application logic error

### Resource Utilization
- **Memory Usage**: Well within limits (10GB available)
- **Container Allocation**: 
  - Requested: 2 containers
  - Allocated: 2 containers
  - Memory per container: 3332MB
- **Executor Distribution**:
  - Executor #1: core-1-1.c-dca6391bee134114
  - Executor #2: core-1-2.c-dca6391bee134114

### Notable Events
1. Application startup: 23:25:38
2. Resource allocation: 23:25:40
3. Container launch: 23:25:41
4. Driver termination: 23:25:48
5. Total runtime: ~10 seconds

## 3. System Health Assessment
### Service Status
- All core services running:
  - HDFS
  - YARN
  - Spark
  - ZooKeeper
- No swap usage (0B/0B)
- Healthy memory distribution

### Application History
- Total applications: 5
  - 4 completed successfully
  - 1 running (Thrift JDBC/ODBC Server)
- No resource-related failures

### Performance Observations
1. Quick executor allocation (within 1 second)
2. Proper cleanup of staging directories
3. Normal memory utilization patterns

## 4. Recommendations
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Enable short-circuit local reads for HDFS
   - Consider increasing executor cores for better parallelism

2. **Monitoring Improvements**:
   - Implement detailed Spark metrics collection
   - Add application-specific logging

3. **Resource Configuration**:
   - Current resource allocation is appropriate for workload
   - No immediate scaling needed

## 5. Conclusion
The cluster is healthy and properly configured. While the application shows as SUCCEEDED, the quick termination pattern suggests potential areas for optimization in the job implementation. The cluster resources are well-balanced for the current workload.
